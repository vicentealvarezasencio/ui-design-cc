## Screen Spec → Generic Prompt

1. **Describe, don't prescribe:**
   - Say what it looks like, not how to build it
   - Use visual language, not technical terms
   - Assume no specific component library

2. **Be explicit about everything:**
   - Don't assume defaults
   - Specify colors as hex codes
   - Describe spacing in pixels or relative terms
   - Mention all visual attributes

3. **Structure clearly:**
   - Use numbered lists for elements
   - Group related information
   - Include all sections even if simple

4. **Include context:**
   - What kind of app this is for
   - The purpose of the screen
   - User goal on this screen
   - Industry/domain if relevant

5. **Use universal terminology:**
   - "button" not "Button component"
   - "text entry field" not "Input"
   - "dropdown selector" not "Select"
   - "card container" not "Card"

6. **Be tool-agnostic:**
   - No component library references
   - No framework terminology
   - No CSS class names
   - Pure visual description

<dark_mode>

## Dark Mode Descriptions

When design tokens include dark mode values, describe both modes.

### Detecting Dark Mode Tokens

Check for `$extensions.mode.dark` in tokens:
```json
{
  "color": {
    "background": {
      "default": {
        "$value": "#FFFFFF",
        "$extensions": {
          "mode": { "dark": "#0F172A" }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Describing Light Mode

```
VISUAL STYLE — LIGHT MODE

Colors:
- Page background: Off-white (#F8FAFC), soft and easy on the eyes
- Card/surface: Pure white (#FFFFFF) with subtle shadow
- Primary text: Near-black (#0F172A) for excellent readability
- Secondary text: Medium gray (#64748B) for less prominent content
- Primary action: Vibrant blue (#2563EB) for buttons and links
- Borders: Light gray (#E2E8F0), barely visible but defining edges

Mood: Clean, airy, professional, daytime-friendly
```

### Describing Dark Mode

```
VISUAL STYLE — DARK MODE

Colors:
- Page background: Deep slate (#0F172A), rich and dark
- Card/surface: Slightly lighter (#1E293B) to create depth
- Primary text: Off-white (#F1F5F9) for comfortable reading
- Secondary text: Muted slate (#94A3B8) for less prominent content
- Primary action: Slightly brighter blue (#3B82F6) for visibility
- Borders: Dark gray (#334155), subtle but visible

Mood: Modern, focused, reduced eye strain, night-friendly
```

### Both Modes in One Prompt

```
Generate this screen with both LIGHT and DARK mode versions.

LAYOUT
[Same layout description for both]

CONTENT
[Same content for both]

LIGHT MODE COLORS
- Background: Light gray (#F8FAFC)
- Card: White (#FFFFFF)
- Text: Dark slate (#0F172A)
- Muted: Gray (#64748B)
- Primary: Blue (#2563EB)
- Border: Light gray (#E2E8F0)

DARK MODE COLORS
- Background: Deep slate (#0F172A)
- Card: Dark slate (#1E293B)
- Text: Off-white (#F1F5F9)
- Muted: Light slate (#94A3B8)
- Primary: Bright blue (#3B82F6)
- Border: Dark gray (#334155)

Both modes use the same layout, spacing, and typography.
The difference is purely in color values.
```

### Transition Descriptions

```
When switching modes:
- Background smoothly transitions (300ms)
- Text colors change together
- Shadows adjust for dark surfaces
- No layout shift occurs
```

</dark_mode>

<iteration_guidance>

## When Results Need Refinement

### General refinement pattern:
```
Adjust the previous design:
1. [Specific change with before/after]
2. [Specific change with before/after]
3. [Specific change with before/after]

Keep everything else the same.
```

### Layout corrections:

The [section] should be [above/below/left of/right of] the [other section].
Center the [element] horizontally.
Add more space between [element A] and [element B].
```

### Color corrections:
```
Change the [element] color from [current] to [new color] (#HEXVAL).

```

### Typography corrections:
```

Improve readability by increasing line spacing.
```

### Component corrections:
```
Make the [button/input/card] more [rounded/squared].
Add a [shadow/border] to [element].
Change [element] to appear [more prominent/more subtle].
```

### Content corrections:
```
Change the [heading/label/button text] to "[new text]".
Add a [subtitle/helper text/description] below [element].
Remove the [element] from the design.
```

## Adapting for Specific Tools

If using a specific tool and generic prompt doesn't work well:

### ChatGPT/DALL-E
- Focus on visual description
- Be explicit about layout positioning
- Describe as "UI mockup" or "interface design"

### Midjourney
- Add "UI design, clean interface, modern"
- Specify aspect ratio
- Less technical, more aesthetic language

### Claude Artifacts
- Can be more technical
- Describe HTML/CSS structure if helpful
- Request interactive elements

### Galileo AI
- Very visual descriptions work well
- Focus on aesthetics and feel
- Good for marketing pages

### New/Unknown Tools
- Start with basic structure
- Test and iterate
- Note what works for future use

</tool_compatibility_notes>

<diff_from_other_adapters>

## Key Differences: Generic vs Specific Adapters

| Aspect | Generic | Stitch | V0 | Figma |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|-------|
| Language | Descriptive | Visual + hex | Technical | Token-based |
| Component refs | None | Natural language | shadcn names | Figma terms |
| Code output | Never assumed | HTML/CSS/Flutter | React + Tailwind | Variables/JSON |
| Best for | Unknown tools | Quick visuals | React code | Design files |

## When to Use Generic
- Tool not yet supported by adapter
- Tool documentation incomplete
- Testing new AI design tools
- Need tool-agnostic documentation
- Fallback when specific adapter fails

## When to Use Specific Adapter
- Tool is known (Stitch, V0, Figma)
- Need optimized output
- Want tool-specific features
- Higher success rate expected

</diff_from_other_adapters>

<best_practices>

**Do:**
- Use plain English descriptions
- Include all visual details
- Provide hex codes for all colors
- Describe layout relationships
- Include interaction hints
- Use universal terminology
- Be explicit, not implicit
- Describe what you see, not how to build

**Don't:**
- Use component library names
- Assume technical knowledge
- Skip "obvious" details
- Use shorthand or abbreviations
- Reference external systems
- Use CSS class names
- Use framework terminology
- Assume defaults

</best_practices>
